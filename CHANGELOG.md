| 0.1.0   | `378b2d7`        | Simplest packaging as a gem as possible                                                         |

**note on version 0.2.0**: FontAwesome now includes scss and sass files, but
when I used them instead of the plain ol css file included in the project, it
wanted some compass libraries.  I'm a fan of compass, but including an entire
tool like that in order to generate a @font_face tag seems a little much... I
don't want this gem to require compass for such a trivial thing, so we are
staying on the vanilla css file for now.

**Running on Rails 3.1?** Make sure to use version 3.1.1.0 or earlier.

**Upgrading from 3.*?** FontAwesome now requires the use of the fa class
with every icon. Prepend the `fa` class to existing icons:

```css
  /* FontAwesome 3 Syntax */
  <i class="icon-github"></i>

  /* FontAwesome 4 Syntax */
  <i class="fa fa-github"></i>
```
