# font-awesome-rails [![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/font-awesome-rails.png)](http://badge.fury.io/rb/font-awesome-rails) [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/bokmann/font-awesome-rails.png)](http://travis-ci.org/bokmann/font-awesome-rails)

font-awesome-rails provides the
[Font-Awesome](http://fortawesome.github.com/Font-Awesome/) web fonts and
stylesheets as a Rails engine for use with the asset pipeline.

## Installation

Add this to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem "font-awesome-rails"
```

and run `bundle install`.

## Usage

In your `application.css`, include the css file:

```css
/*
 *= require font-awesome
 */
```
Then restart your webserver if it was previously running.

Congrats! You now have scalable vector icon support. Pick an icon and check out the
[FontAwesome Examples](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/examples/).

### Sass Support

If you prefer [SCSS](http://sass-lang.com/docs.html), add this to your
`application.css.scss` file:

```scss
@import "font-awesome";
```

If you use the
[Sass indented syntax](http://sass-lang.com/docs/yardoc/file.INDENTED_SYNTAX.html),
add this to your `application.css.sass` file:

```sass
@import font-awesome
```

### IE7 Support

If you must support IE7, use a
[conditional comment](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conditional_comment) to
provide the `font-awesome-ie7.min.css` stylesheet to Internet Explorer.

```rhtml
<!--[if lt IE 8]>
<%= stylesheet_link_tag "font-awesome-ie7.min.css", media: "all" %>
<![endif]-->
```

In haml, that would look like:

```haml
/[if lt IE 8]
  = stylesheet_link_tag "font-awesome-ie7.min.css", media: "all"
```

Either way, Make sure that `font-awesome-ie7.min.css` is part of `config.assets.precompile` in your `environments/production.rb`.

```ruby
config.assets.precompile += %w( font-awesome-ie7.min.css )
```

Alternatively, if you already have a CSS file provided by a conditional
comment (say, `application-ie.css`), you can include the ie7 styleshet in
that:

```css
/*
 *= require font-awesome-ie7.min
 */
```

### Helpers

There are also some helpers (`fa_icon` and `fa_stacked_icon`) that make your
views _icontastic!_.

```ruby
fa_icon "camera-retro"
# => <i class="icon-camera-retro"></i>

fa_icon "camera-retro", text: "Take a photo"
# => <i class="icon-camera-retro"></i> Take a photo

fa_icon "quote-left 4x muted", class: "pull-left"
# => <i class="icon-quote-left icon-4x icon-muted pull-left"></i>

content_tag(:li, fa_icon("ok li", text: "Bulleted list item"))
# => <li><i class="icon-ok icon-li"></i> Bulleted list item</li>
```

```ruby
fa_stacked_icon "twitter", base: "check-empty"
# => <span class="icon-stack">
# =>   <i class="icon-check-empty icon-stack-base"></i>
# =>   <i class="icon-twitter"></i>
# => </span>

fa_stacked_icon "terminal light", base: "sign-blank", class: "pull-right", text: "Hi!"
# => <span class="icon-stack pull-right">
# =>   <i class="icon-sign-blank icon-stack-base"></i>
# =>   <i class="icon-terminal icon-light"></i>
# => </span> Hi!

```

**Note:** In Rails 3.2, make sure font-awesome-rails is outside the bundler asset group
so that these helpers are automatically loaded in production environments.

**note on version 0.2.0**: FontAwesome now includes scss and sass files, but
when I used them instead of the plain ol css file included in the project, it
wanted some compass libraries.  I'm a fan of compass, but including an entire
tool like that in order to generate a @font_face tag seems a little much... I
don't want this gem to require compass for such a trivial thing, so we are
staying on the vanilla css file for now.

**Running on Rails 3.1?** Make sure to use version 3.1.1.0 or earlier.
